NeoVim configurations for AHIR development

This project configures neovim (nvim) to work better with AHIR development. 

- To start with AHIR development we need to install ghdl with llvm or gcc backend. This is done by running the shell script [install_ghdl_gcc_backend.sh](install_ghdl_gcc_backend.sh).
