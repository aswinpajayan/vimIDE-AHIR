NeoVim configurations for AHIR development

This project configures neovim (nvim) to work better with AHIR development. 

## Installing dependencies for AHIRv2
- To start with AHIR development we need to install ghdl with llvm or gcc backend. This is done by running the shell script [install_ghdl_gcc_backend.sh](install_ghdl_gcc_backend.sh). The file was taken in [VHDL Tutorial by ymahajan456](https://github.com/ymahajan456/Tutorials/tree/master/VHDL_Tutorial/Installation). This project is tested in lubuntu 14 on a VM 
  - Os : lubuntu 14 (VM)
